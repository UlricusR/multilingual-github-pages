# Building a Multi-Lingual GitHub Page
*A step-by-step guide to build a multi-lingual website in GitHub Pages using Jekyll*

GitHub Pages offers great possibilities to host static, version controlled homepages. One downside is the support for only a [limited amount of jekyll-plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/).
