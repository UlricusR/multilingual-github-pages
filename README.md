# Building a Multi-Lingual GitHub Page with Unsupported Jekyll Plugins

*A step-by-step guide to build a multi-lingual website using Jekyll plugins not supported by GitHub Pages*

GitHub Pages offers great possibilities to host static, version controlled homepages. One downside is the support for only a [limited amount of Jekyll-plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/). I was especially interested in using the [Polyglot plugin](https://github.com/untra/polyglot), because my website needed to be available in English and German.

As GitHub Pages does not support this specific plugin, I searched for workarounds. The most promising one I found in [Dani's Braindump blog](https://tiefenauer.github.io/blog/gh-pages-plugins/), which I will apply with some modifications. I have described my experience in setting up a multi-language site in GitHub Pages in [this step-by-step guide](https://ulricusr.github.io/multilingual-github-pages/).

You can also use this repository as a blueprint to start your own multi-lingual website. Just fork it and use the file structure as a template. However, do read the necessary steps carefully, as you'll need to understand how to set up and maintain your website.
