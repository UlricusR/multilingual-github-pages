This is the second release of the *GitHub multilingual pages* project.

Changes:
- The complete description is now available in English as well as in German directly on the site
- To keep things consistent, the README has been striped down to only show the link to the site.

Stay tuned - e.g. by subscribing to this blog via RSS.
