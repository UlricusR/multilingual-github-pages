GitHub Pages offers great possibilities to host static, version controlled homepages. One downside is the support for only a [limited amount of Jekyll-plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/). I was especially interested in using the [jekyll-multiple-language-plugin](https://github.com/kurtsson/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin), because my website needed to be available in English and German.

As GitHub Pages does not support this specific plugin, I searched for workarounds. The most promising one I found in [Dani's Braindump blog](https://tiefenauer.github.io/blog/gh-pages-plugins/), which I applied with some modifications. I have described the procedure step-by-step in the README of [the related GitHub repository](https://github.com/UlricusR/multilingual-github-pages).
